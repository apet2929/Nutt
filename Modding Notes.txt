WHEN DEBUGGING: Things to look out for
-Files are in the correct folders, folders are in the correct spot
-Trailing commas
-Typos
-Things named incorrectly
-If texture isnt loading,
    -In models and blockstates, make sure the directions are named the same thing, and that they line up

How to make block, step by step
    1) Create block class inside (com/creatorname/modid/blocks)
    2) Register block in the mod class with a block and an item (com/creatorname/modid/modid.java)
    3) Instantiate a static block variable in the ModBlocks class (com/creatorname/modid/blocks/ModBlocks.java)

    Now, here you can already access your block. Try it!

    4) Create a blockstates .json for the block named block registry name (resources/assets/modid/blockstates)
    5) Create a model for the block named block unlocalized name (resources/assets/modid/models/block)
    6) Create a third and final .json for the block named block name (resources/assets/modid/models/item)
    7) Add the texture (resources/assets/modid/textures/block)

    Now the block should have a texture. Test again.

    8) Make a loot table so that it drops when destroyed (resources/data/modid/loot_tables/blocks)
    9) Set the displayed name in the language file (assets/modid/lang)
    10) Set the item recipe (resources/data/modid/recipes)
    11) Add it to the creative tab (com/creatorname/modid/modid.java)

How to make an item, step by step
    1) Make the item class (creatorname/modid/items)
    2) Register it in item registry (com/creatorname/modid/modid.java)
    3) Register it in the ModItems class (com/creator/modid/items)

    Now the item should now appear in game

    4) Set the model (resources/assets/modid/models/item)
    5) Add a texture (resources/assets/modid/textures/item) Make sure the designated texture name is the same as the .png name for the texture
    6) Add it in the language file

    Now it should have a texture

    7) Add a recipe
    8) Make a loot table
    9) Set the displayed name
    10) Add it to the creative tab

How to make a tile entity for a block, step by step
    1) Make a tile entity class for it (com/creatorname/modid/blocks)
    2) Make a static variable for it in the ModBlocks class (com/creatorname/modid/blocks/ModBlocks.java)
    3) Register it in the TileEntity registry in the mod class (com/creatorname/modid/modid.java)
    4) Override hasTileEntity and createTileEntity in the block class (com/creatorname/modid/blocks)

How to make a food item, step by step
    1) Make an item class
ADVANCED:
    How to make a block face the direction a player is facing:
        -Add methods onBlockPlacedBy, getFacingFromEntity, and fillStateContainer in the Block Class
        -Only needed if the block has sides that are not all the same (blockstates isnt 1 line)
